### What is this?

This project implements a [Rewrite module](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) that bundles OpenRewrite recipes maintained by third parties.
These recipes are not maintained by the OpenRewrite team, but are still useful for migrating codebases.

## Contributing

We appreciate all types of contributions. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/openrewrite/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started.
